# Daily Sub Goal Widget For Stream Elements

Wasn't too happy with the options offered for daily sub goal widgets within stream elements, so the goal here is to make a clean looking, very readable daily sub goal widget. It will be easy for the end user to change font and also selection of widget colors.

## Things to do

* Figure out how to align everything without weird margin and padding
* Figure out how to use JS to manipulate the percentage
* Add fields for color select & sub goal
